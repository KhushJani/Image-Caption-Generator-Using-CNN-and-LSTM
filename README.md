# Image-Caption-Generator-Using-CNN-and-LSTM

### Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an Image Caption Generator using Python, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The objective is to create a model that can generate natural language descriptions for images, combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

### Description
#### What is an Image Caption Generator?
An Image Caption Generator is a model that interprets the content of an image and generates a descriptive text about it. This involves recognizing the context of the image through computer vision and generating a coherent description using natural language processing.

#### Project Goals
The main goal is to implement an Image Caption Generator using a combination of CNN and LSTM:

  * CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Used for extracting features from images.
  * LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Utilizes the extracted features to generate descriptive captions.

### Dataset
For this project, we use the Flickr_8K dataset, which contains 8,091 images and their respective captions. This dataset is chosen for its manageable size, allowing for quicker training and testing.

### Dataset Structure
[Flickr8k_Dataset](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_Dataset.zip): Contains the image files.
[Flickr_8k_text](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_text.zip): Contains text files with image captions, particularly the Flickr8k.token file, which includes image names and their corresponding captions.

### Project Requirements
Deep Learning Knowledge: Understanding of CNNs and RNNs, specifically LSTM.
Python Programming: Proficiency in Python and familiarity with Jupyter notebooks.
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pillow, tqdm, JupyterLab.

### Project Structure
* Flickr8k_Dataset: Contains 8,091 images.
* Flickr_8k_text: Contains text files and captions.
* Models: Directory to store trained models.
* descriptions.txt: Preprocessed image captions.
* features.p: Pickle file with image feature vectors extracted from the Xception model.
* tokenizer.p: Pickle file containing tokenized words.
* model.png: Visual representation of the model architecture.
* testing_caption_generator.py: Script for generating captions for any image.
* training_caption_generator.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training the model.

### Implementation Steps
1.  Import Necessary Packages:
    * TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pillow, etc.

2.  Data Cleaning:
    * Load and preprocess the captions and images.

3. Feature Extraction:
    * Use the Xception model to extract feature vectors from images.

4.  Dataset Preparation:
    * Load the dataset and prepare it for training.

5.  Tokenize Vocabulary:
    * Create a tokenizer to convert text into sequences of integers.

6.  Data Generator:
    * Create a data generator to feed data into the model.

7.  Define CNN-RNN Model:
    * Build the image caption generator model combining CNN and LSTM.

8.  Train the Model:
    * Train the model using the prepared dataset.

9.  Test the Model:
    * Evaluate the model and generate captions for new images.

### Model Explanation

#### CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
CNNs are specialized neural networks capable of processing 2D matrix inputs such as images. They are effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images.

####  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excel at sequence prediction tasks. They are capable of maintaining long-term dependencies, making them suitable for generating coherent sequences of text.

#### Combined CNN-RNN Model
By merging CNN and LSTM architectures, we create a powerful model that extracts image features using CNN and generates descriptions using LSTM. This approach leverages the strengths of both models to produce accurate and meaningful image captions.
